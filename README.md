## Introduction
Conmon is an exceptional Python terminal application that allows users to effortlessly check the connectivity of websites by sending a HEAD request to the server. It can efficiently detect if a website is online or offline and can also read URLs from a text file for batch checking.

Whether you're a system administrator, developer, or just curious about the status of your favorite websites, Conmon makes it simple to monitor website connectivity.

## Features
Conmon boasts an impressive array of features that set it apart from other website connectivity checkers:

<strong>Website Connectivity Check</strong>: Conmon can determine whether a website is online or offline by sending a HEAD request to the server. This provides quick and efficient results.

<strong>Batch URL Checking</strong>: Not just limited to checking a single website, Conmon can read a list of URLs from a text file and loop through them, displaying the status (online or offline) for each website.

<strong>Informative Output</strong>: Conmon provides clear and informative output that includes the status of each checked website. If a website is offline, it also displays an error message to help diagnose the issue.

<strong>Command-Line Interface (CLI)</strong>: Conmon offers a user-friendly CLI with options to specify URLs directly as arguments or to read them from a file, making it versatile for different use cases.

<strong>Developer-Friendly</strong>: Conmon is an open-source project, which means you can explore its code, contribute to its development, or even use it as a base for your own projects.
